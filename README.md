## Welcome to the Creeper in Contribution Graph user profile!

The goal of this user is not to contribute normally, but to draw the face of a Minecraft creeper in the contribution graph.
I had been wanting to do this for a while, but now I've actually done it. The whole process took 56 days (8 weeks) to complete, and I couldn't mess up once, or I would've had to restart.

Based on some testing I did, your timezone shouldn't affect how the graph appears, but if it does, I made all of my commits between 11:00 AM and 7:00 PM CST, so switching to Central Standard Time should help.

As you may have noticed, a Minecraft creeper face is 8x8, however, a week is only 7 days. To account for this, the top row of pixels is cut off, so it's a 7x8 pixel art instead.
The way I see it though, it just helps to center the face more. It's always bothered me *just a little* that the face is not centered vertically when it could be.

### How I did it

You may be wondering, how have I done this perfectly for 56 days straight? Surely I must have created a bot or something to automate making commits, right? Nope! I've done this all manually, which only makes it more impressive, in my opinion, though it doesn't say much for my coding skills.

Below is my blueprint I used that outlined how many commits were needed for each day:

This image was made via inspect page, but it inspired this project, so now it's real!
